**Concurrency.** 

- Is when multiple tasks start, run and complete in overlapping time periods - not neccesarily simultanously.
- Key poinst:
  * About managing multiple tasks efficiently, eso on a single cpu core.
  * All about task mgt.
  * Goal is responsiveness.

**Parallesim.** 

* Is when multiple tasks are are executed simultaneously, typically on multiple CPU cores.
* Key point:
  * Actual simultaneous execution to speed up p4mance.
  * About task execution.
  * 

Process . 

- Independent program running at its own memory and space.
- Heavier to create and switch.
- Isolated and safer.

Threads:

* Share memory within a browser.
* lightweight and faster.
* Can lead to complex bugs e.g race conditions.
