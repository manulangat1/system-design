REDUDANCY. 

---

* Prevent  single points of failure.

Types of Redudancy. 

---

* Hardware
* Network
* Services.

N+1 Redudancy 

---

* One extra instance thus ensuring availability incase of failure.

Active - Active 

---

Multiple nodes works together, each handling requests thus leading to high availability and load distribution. 

Active-Passive 

---

One active node, others are stand by and only activate on failure. - Simpler but less efficient for load balancing. 


Graceful degradation.
---------------------

---

System Operates at a reduced capacity during failures. 


High availability patterns in real world systems. 

---

1. Load balancers.
2. Replication.
3. Fail over
